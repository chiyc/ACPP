# ACPP
Practice code for exercises and readings from Accelerated C++

This is a repository to be filled with my responses to exercises from Accelerated C++. As my first experience with C++ and a formal version control system, I expect this to experience growing pains.

If anyone found inspiration to dig through any of this, then please reach out to me with any suggestions or feedback.
