4-1. We noted in ยง4.2.3/65 that it is essential that the argument types in a call to max
match exactly. Will the following code work? If there is a problem, how would you fix it?

int maxlen;
Student_info s;
max(s.name.size(), maxlen);

// The code as given does not work because the type of s.name.size() is std::string::size_type
// while the type of maxlen is int.

// The code can be rewritten to initiate maxlen with the following declaration,

// std::string::size_type maxlen;
